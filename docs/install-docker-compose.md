# Install docker-compose

`docker-compose` can be installed following [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-one-install-docker-desktop/). 

The documentation refers to installation using Debian's package manager, although I would recommend not use this method to avoid changing (updating, upgrading) curret versions of dependencies on the system, which can lead to system malfunctioning.

Recommendation: Use the [manual installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually) method. This will only download and place a pre-compiled binary file on the system.
